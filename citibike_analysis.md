### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to determine if Citibike would be successful in Des Moines, IA. We saw the success of Citibike in New York City and wanted to bring it to our city. We will look at a few different factors to determine the viability of the venture.


### Methodology Used For Analysis

To justify opening Citibike in Des Moines, we looked at a few different factors. We looked at factors that may contribute to the success of the company in NY City. Then, we compared the location of the stations and McDonald restaurants in NY City. Finally, we compared the populations of the two cities.

When looking at the factors that make NY City a successful place for Citibike to be stationed in, we observe that the younger the user, the longer they ride for. We also notice there are a lot of stations available but there are some that have more traffic than others. The majority of users ended up being male, followed by females, then some unknown gendered people. 

In the second slide of the story, we compare the location of the top starting stations for rides, filtered to include those with over 9899 rides, with a map of McDonald's locations across the city. There is some overlap, indicating that it may be feasible and lucrative to have stations built close to McDonald's across the city.

To shore up this argument, we looked at the top ending stations side-by-side with the McDonald's across the city. There is also still some intersection between the two, supporting the notion that stations should be near McDonald's restaurants.

The next slide of the story displays the McDonald's restaurants in the Des Moines area, showing potential locations to build stations. The locations of the stores are well distributed, and should allow for a many options throughout the city.

Finally, we looked at four tables that compare the populations between the two cities, as well as the gender proportion. NY City has 65% of their population within the ages of 18 to 65. Des Moines has 63.8% of their population falling within the same age bracket. NY does have slightly more people per household but are still comparable. NY also has more people and more population density than Des Moines, so this should be a consideration when determining the number of bicycles to have available at each station. NY City and Des Moines also have 52.3% and 50.8% of their populations comprised of females. Since NY had the majority of their users be male, Des Moines has a larger male proportion, which should translate to more riders.


### Future Considerations

For future considerations I would include a map with landmarks and historic features of NY City and compare it to the stations as well. Then see if there is a basis to have stations closer to landmarks as opposed to McDonald restaurants.
